Qualia Challenge

I would like to use this README to remind you that I am applying to work with data and not as a web-dev, which I'm sure will be clear to you once you see this project.  This was my first experience with Meteor and my first time working with html and javascript in a few years.  

There are a number of obvious flaws with this project, most notably that the visibility of many of the divs is only correct for one of the two players.  If I had more time, that would be my number one priority, as it directly interferes with the usability of the game.  Another obvious change would be to simplify the code so that only one template was needed for each player with some parameter passed in to differentiate between the players.  This would eliminate significant amounts of duplicate code in both the html and javascript.  If I had time, I would like to add to change other things about this project, such as using css correctly, but correctly showing divs and reducing redundant code would be my top two priorities.
